Auraxium is an object-oriented Python wrapper for the `PlanetSide 2 <https://www.planetside2.com/home>`_ API.

It provides a comprehensive object model respresentation of the API data that facilitates the creation of bots and utilities without requiring deep knowledge of the API and its idiosyncrasies.
